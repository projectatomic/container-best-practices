== Audience

This documentation has been written specifically for the developers who are writing
Dockerfiles to create images.  Dockerfiles can become rather complex depending on the
application being containerized so we are passing on our experience with Dockerfiles
through a series of best practices.

This guide of best practices is not a reference guide of all the Dockerfile instructions.  There
is plenty of documentation available on the link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker website] should
you require that sort of content.
