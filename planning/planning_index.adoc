As you begin to contemplate the containerization of your application, there are number of factors that
should be considered prior to authoring a Dockerfile.  You will want to plan out everything from
how to start the application, to network considerations, to making sure your image is architected in a way that
can run in multiple environments like Atomic Host or OpenShift.

The very act of containerizing any application presents a few hurdles that are perhaps considered
defacto in a traditional Linux environment.  The following sections highlight these hurdles and
offer solutions which would be typical in a containerized environment.

=== Security and user requirements

=== Host and image synchronization

Some applications that run in containers require the host and container to more or less be synchronized on certain
attributes so their behaviors are also similar.  One such common attribute can be time.  The following sections discuss
best practices to keeping those attributes similar or the same.

==== Time

Consider a case where multiple containers (and the host) are running applications and logging to something like
a log server.  The log timestamps and information would almost be entirely useless if each container reported a different
time than the host.

The best way to synchronize the time between a container and its host is through the use of bind mounts.  You simply need
to bind mount the host's _/etc/localtime_ with the container's _/etc/localtime_.  We use the _ro_ flag to ensure the container
can't modify the host's time zone by default.

In your Dockerfile, this can be accomplished by adding the following to your RUN label.

.Synchronizing the timezone of the host to the container.
```
-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
```

==== Machine ID

The _/etc/machine_id_ file is often used as an identifier for things like applications and logging.  Depending on your
application, it might be beneficial to also bind mount the machine id of the host into the container.  For example.
in many cases journald relies on the machine ID for identification.  The sosreport application also uses it.  To bind
mount the machine ID of the host to the container, add something like the following to your RUN label.

.Synchronizing the host machine ID with a container
```
-v /etc/machine_id:/etc/machine_id:ro
```

[[planning_starting_application]]
=== Starting your applications within a container
At some point in the design of your Dockerfile and image, you will need to determine how to start your
application.  There are three prevalent methods for starting applications:

- Call the application binary directly
- Call a script that results in your binary starting
- Use systemd to start the application

For the most part, there is no single right answer on which method should be used; however, there are
some softer decision points that might help you decide which would be easiest for you as the
Dockerfile owner.

==== Calling the binary directly
If your application is not service-oriented, calling the binary directly might be the simplest and most
straight-forward method to start a container.  There is no memory overhead and no additional packages
are needed (like systemd and its dependencies).  However, it is more difficult to deal with
setting environment variables.

==== Using a script
Using a special script to start your application in a container can be a handy way to deal with slightly
more complex applications.  One upside is that it is generally trivial to set environment variables.  This
method is also good when you need to call more than a single binary to start the application correctly.
One downside is that you now have to maintain the script and ensure it is always present in the image.

[[planning_use_systemd]]
==== Use systemd
Using systemd to start your application is a great if your application is service-oriented (like httpd).
It can benefit from leveraging well tested unit files generally delivered with the applications
themselves and therefore can make complex applications that require environment variables easy to work
with.  One disadvantage is that systemd will increase the size of your image and there is a small
amount of memory used for systemd itself.

NOTE: As of docker-1.10, the docker run parameter of _--privileged_ is no longer needed to use systemd
within a container.

You can implement using link:#creating_using_systemd[systemd fairly simply in your Dockerfile].

[[planning_storage]]
=== Storage Considerations

When you architect your container image, storage can certainly be a critical consideration.  The power of containers is
that they can mimic, replicate, or replace all kinds of applications and therein lies why you must be careful in
considering how you deal with storage needs.

By nature, the storage for containers is ephemeral.  This makes sense because one of the attractions of containers
is that they can be easily created, deleted, replicated, and so on.  If no consideration to storage is given, the
container will only have access to its own filesystem.  This means if the container is deleted, whatever information
whether it is logs or data will be lost.  For some applications, this is perfectly acceptable if not preferred.

However, if your application generates important data that should be retained or perhaps could be shared amongst
multiple containers, you will need to ensure that this storage is setup for the user.

==== Persistent storage for containers: Data Volumes

Docker defines link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/[persistent storage] in two ways.

. Data volumes
. Data volume containers

However at present, the use of link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/#data-volumes[data volumes]
is emerging to be the preferred storage option for users of Docker.  The docker website defines a data volume as
_"a specially-designated directory within one or more containers that bypasses the Union File System."_ It has the distinct
advantages that they can they can be shared and reused for one or more containers.  Moreover, a data volume will
persist even if the associated container is deleted.

Data volumes must be explicitly created and preferbaly should be named to provide it with a meaningful name.  You can
manually create a data volume with the _docker volume create_ command.

.Creating a data volume for persistent storage
```
$ docker volume create <image_name>
```

NOTE: You can also specify a driver name with the -d option

===== Using data volumes in a Dockerfile

For developers whose applications require persistent storage, the trick will be instantiating the data volume
prior to running the image.  This, however, can be achieved leveraging the link:#label_action[LABEL metadata]
and applications like atomic.

We recommend that the data volume be created through the use of the INSTALL label.  If you recall, the INSTALL label
is meant to identify a script that should be run prior to ever running the image. In that install script, adding
something like the following can be used to create the data volume.

.Creating a data volume in your install script
```
chroot /host /usr/bin/docker volume create <image_name>
```

To then use the data volume, the RUN label would need to use the bind mount feature.  Adding the following to your
RUN label would bind mount the data volume by name:

.Adding a data volume by name into your RUN label
```
-v <data_volume_name>:/<mount_path_inside_container>
```

==== Persistent storage for containers: Mounting a directory from the host
You can also leverage the host filesystem for persistent storage through the use of bind mounts.  The basic idea for this
is to use a directory on the host filesystem that will be bind mounted into the container at runtime.  This can be simply
used by adding a bind mount to your RUN label:

.Bind mounting a directory from the rootfs to a running container
```
-v /<path_on_the_rootfs>:/<mount_path_inside_container>
```

One downside to this approach is that anyone with privileges to that directory on the host will be able to view and
possibly alter the content.

==== OpenShift persistent storage
==== Storage backends for persistent storage

=== Logging

If your application logs actions, errors, and warnings to some sort of log mechanism, you will want to consider how
to allows users to obtain, review, and possible retain those logs.  The flexibility of a container environment
can however present some challenges when it comes to logging because typically your containers are separated
by namespace and cannot leverage the system logging without some explicit action by the users.  There are also
several solutions for logging containers like:

* using a logging service like rsyslog or fluentd
* setting the docker daemon's log driver
* logging to a file shared with the host (bind mounting)

As a developer, if your application uses logging of some manner, you should be thinking about how you will
handle your log files.  Each of aforementioned solutions has its pros and cons.

[[logging_use_service]]
==== Using a logging service

Most traditional Linux systems use a logging service like link:http://www.rsyslog.com/[rsyslog] to collect and store
its log files.  Often the logging service will coordinate logging with journald but nevertheless it too is a service
will accept log input.

If your application uses a logger and you want to take advantage of the host's logger, you can bind mount _/dev/log_
between the host and container as part of the RUN label like so:

```
-v /dev/log:/dev/log
```

Depending on the host distribution, log messages will now be in the host's journald and subsequently into
_/var/log/messages_ assumming the host is using something like rsyslog.

==== Setting the log driver for docker daemon

Docker has the ability to link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/[configure a logging driver].  When
implemented, it will impact all containers on the system.  This is only useful when you can ensure that the
host will only be running your application as this might impact other containers.  Therefore this method has limited
usefulness unless you can ensure the final runtime environment.

[[logging_host_shared_storage]]
==== Using shared storage with the host

The use of xref:planning_storage[persistent storage] can be another effective way to deal with log files whether
you choose to perform a simple bind mount with the host or data volumes.  Like  using a logging service, it has the
advantage that the logs can be preserved irregardless of the state of the container.  Shared storage also reduces
the potential to chew up filesystem space assigned to the container itself.  You can bind mount either a file or
directory between host and container using the _-v_ flag in your RUN label.

```
-v <host_dir|file>:<image_dir|file>
```

==== Logging in OpenShift

OpenShift automatically collects logs of image builds and processes running inside containers. The recommended way to log for containers running in OpenShift is to send the output to standard output or standard error rather than storing it in a file. This way, OpenShift can catch the logs and output them directly in the console or on the command line (_oc logs_).

=== Security and User considerations

==== Passing credentials and secrets

Storing sensitive data like credentials is a hot topic, especially because Docker does not provide a designated option for storing and passing secret values to containers.

Currently, a very popular way to pass credentials and secrets in a container is specifying them as **environment variables** at container runtime. You as a consumer of such an image don't expose any of your sensitive data publicly.

However, this approach also has caveats: 

* If you commit such a container and push your changes to a registry, the final image will contain also all your sensitive data publicly.

* Processes inside your container and other containers linked to your container might be able to access this information. Similarily, everything you pass as an environment variable is accessible from the host machine using *docker inspect* as seen in the https://hub.docker.com/r/openshift/mysql-56-centos7/[mysql example below].

```
# docker run -d --name mysql_database -e MYSQL_USER=user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db -p 3306:3306 openshift/mysql-56-centos
# docker inspect openshift/mysql-56-centos

<snip>

"Env": [
            "MYSQL_USER=user",
            "MYSQL_PASSWORD=password",
            "MYSQL_DATABASE=db",

<snip>


```

There are other ways how to store secrets and although using environment variables might lead to leaking private data in certain corner cases, it still belongs to the safest workarounds available.

There are a couple of things to keep in mind when operating with secrets:

* For obvious reasons, you should avoid using default passwords - users tend to forget to change the default configuration and in case a known password leaks, it can be easily misused.

* Although squashing removes intermediate layers from the final image, secrets from those layers will still be present in the build cache.

===== Handling Secrets in Kubernetes

Containers running through Kubernetes can take advantage of the **secret** resource type to store sensitive data such as passwords or tokens. kubernetes uses tmpfs volumes for storing secrets. To learn how to create and access these, refer to the http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/secrets/[Kubernetes User Guide].


===== Other Projects Facilitating Secret Management

**Custodia**

Custodia is an open-source project that defines an API for storing and sharing secrets such as passwords and certificates in a way that keeps data secure, manageable and audiatable. Custodia uses the HTTP protocol and a RESTful API as an IPC mechanism over a local Unix Socket. Custodia is fully modular and usrs can control how authentication, authorization and API plugins are combined and exposed. You can learn more details on the project's https://github.com/latchset/custodia[github repository] or https://github.com/latchset/custodia/wiki[wiki page].

**Vault**

Another open-source project that aims to handle secure accessing and storing of secrets is Vault. Detailed information about the tool and use cases can be found on the https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/index.html[Vault project website].

=== Preventing your image users from filling the filesystem

Most default docker deployments only set aside about 20GB of storage for each container.  For many applications, that
amount of storage is more than enough.  But if your containerized application produces significant log output,
or your deployment scenario restarts containers infrequently, file system space can become a concern.


The first step to preventing the container filesystem from filling up is to make sure your images
are link:#creating_concise[small and concise].  This obviously will reduce how much space your
image consumes from the filesystem right away. However, as a developer, the following techniques
can be used by you to manage the container filesystem size.



==== Ask for a larger storage space on run

One solution to dealing with filesystem space could be to increase the amount of storage allocated to the container when
your image is run.  This can be achieved with the following switch to _docker run_.

.Increase the container storage space to 60GB
```
--storage-opt size:60
```

If you are using a defined RUN label in your Dockerfile, you could add the switch to that label.  However,
abuse of this switch could lead to irking users and you should be prudent in using it.

==== Space considerations for logging

Logging can sometimes unknowingly consume disk space, particularily when a service or daemon has
failed.  If your application performs logging, or more specifically verbose logging, consider the
following approaches to help keep filesystem usage down:

* Use logrotate inside the container periodically.
* Mount your logs to a link:#logging_host_shared_storage[shared host filesystem]
* link:#logging_use_service[Use a logging service or the host's journalctl (/dev/log)]

=== Deployment Considerations

Preparing applications for production distribution and deployment must carefully consider the supported
deployment platforms. Production services require high uptime, injection of private or sensitive data,
storage integration and configuration control. The deployment platform determines methods for load balancing,
scheduling and upgrading. A platform that does not provide these services requires additional work when
developing the container packaging.
